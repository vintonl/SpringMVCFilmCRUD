## Spring MVC Film C.R.U.D. Project

### Week 8 Weekend Project at Skill Distillery

Built by Vinton Lee and Brian Streetman, and this project is our first partner project and first Dynamic Web Applications.

### Overview:

This program is designed to a be website application that creates, reads, updates and deletes film data from a database using Java Database Connectivity.

### How to run:

First, the user enters the index page. The user can choose to:
1. Lookup a film.
2. Add a film.

On the "Lookup a film" page, the user can choose to:
1. Search for a film by its ID.
2. Search the films by keyword or phrase found in the title or description.

The website application will then start the search process of the database and return the result of the search with all of the film's data. The user will then have the option to either update the film's attributes, delete the film from the database, or return to the index page.

### Technologies used:

Java, Spring, Gradle, SQL, MySQL, Apache, Tomcat, AWS, Spring STS, Atom, Git, and Github.

### Topics implemented:

Dynamic Web Applications using Spring MVC.

Tomcat8 on AWS EC2 Instance.

JSP Standard Tag Library to generate HTML.

Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) including Nested Retrieval and Prepared Statement.

Relational Databases: SQL Databases and Java Database Connectivity.

Java Libraries: SQL, ArrayList, List, and handling exceptions.

Object-Oriented Programming in Java: Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, and Encapsulation.

Test Driven Development using JUNIT Juniper.

### Lessons learned:

This project helped us better grasp the capabilities of Dynamic Web Applications by allowing us to better learn how to:
1. Use a controller for dependency injection and grasping how it passes information.
2. Understand Component and ModelAttribute annotations.
3. Understand Spring Application Contexts.
4. Use the JSP Standard Tag Library to generate HTML.
5. Build a Dynamic Web Applications using Spring MVC.
